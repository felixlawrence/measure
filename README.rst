Measure
===============================

Simple command line tool to collect a time series, one data point at a time.


Most of the documentation has been autogenerated and not edited - this is not a well-supported project! Also, the tests are blank and probably don't work. Accordingly, I haven't uploaded this to pypi or anywhere other than github!

It saves its database in `~/Documents/measurements.db` - you'll probably want to change this by editing `DB_PATH` in `measure/measure.py`.
